The general idea is that submissions to reddit should be made by *redditors*, not site owners. For more information on this, please see the [\"What Constitutes Spam?\" section of the reddit FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/help/faq#Whatconstitutesspam). If you'd like to promote your site on reddit, please look into [the self-serve advertising (promoted links) system](http://www.reddit.com/ad_inq/).\n\n* NSFW submissions must be labeled.\n\n* No \"general\" URL shorteners (bit.ly, tinyurl, etc). Site-specific ones are okay.\n\n* Links related to piracy and online gambling are not permitted.\n\nIf your submission satisfies these rules but still doesn't seem to show up, it's probably nothing personal, the gaming spam-filter is just extremely aggressive and removes many submissions automatically. **Don't delete your submission**, that will make the filter hate you even more.
